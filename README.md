# Xiaomi-Dafang-as-Wifi-Access-Point
This is a version of the firmware_mod SD card files which uses hostapd to make your wifi cam accessible as a wifi access point

firmware_mod.zip is a functioning example that can be applied straight to the SD card as of [cfw 1.3](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/blob/master/hacks/cfw/dafang/cfw-1.3.bin) on a wyze pan
